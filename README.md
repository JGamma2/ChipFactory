# ChipFactory

Here's the idea.
It's a factory, for chips.
There's a farm, that makes ingredients.
There's a silo, that stores ingredients, and chips.
Chips get sent off for money.
Upgrades.
Basically just an idle game with chips.

Potato chips, eventually unlock corn chips.
Ultra final secret unlock, chocolate chips.
Wood chips in crazy post release update.
Poker chips paid dlc.

Margaret farms the farms, sends it off to Penny to make the chips, sends to Taryn, who packages it.
