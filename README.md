# ChipFactory

Here's the idea.
It's a factory, for chips.
There's a farm, that makes ingredients.
There's a silo, that stores ingredients, and chips.
Chips get sent off for money.
Upgrades.
Basically just an idle game with chips.

Potato chips, eventually unlock corn chips.
Ultra final secret unlock, chocolate chips.
Wood chips in crazy post release update.
Poker chips paid dlc.

Margaret farms the farms, sends it off to Penny to make the chips, sends to Taryn, who packages it.

I don't care what they say, I won't stay in a world wihtout love.

Backlog:
Ok so here's the plan.
I need the farming divs extant.
Model chip bags and plants in various life stages.
Async these brothas so it works.
Sidebar mennuu.
Fire css transition.
Oh my goodness crank this thing full of css.
I \<3 css.
Ok change of plans we putting Sidebar mennuu before the async crap.
The mennuu will control the game so why would I do it later.
Should be positioned absolutely and possibly off to the side and do a little slide.
OOOOOOOUUUUHHHHHH a nice little css slide for my mennuu.
And then forget about the project and do that cs repo I found.
Probably more important I do that but this is fun.
Actually I like this menu it should be numba 1 priority.
I am the ruler here.
I need to call myself hot at least 15 times in this whole thing.
JGamma2, the hottest dev this side of the Araguaia River.
Ok this whole backlog has gone completely off the rails.
You can tell I have no idea how to use a backlog.
This is useless but I love it.
