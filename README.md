# ChipFactory

Here's the idea.
It's a factory, for chips.
There's a farm, that makes ingredients.
There's a silo, that stores ingredients, and chips.
Chips get sent off for money.
Upgrades, idle game with chips.

Potato chips, eventually unlock corn chips.
Ultra final secret unlock, chocolate chips.

Ostritch farms the farms, sends it off to [REDACTED] to make the chips, sends to the sea cucumber, who packages it.
